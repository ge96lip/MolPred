# Analyzing SPID in Molecular Graphs

This repository will explore the application of the Shortest Path Index of Dispersion (SPID) to molecular graphs derived from treated and untreated cancer cell line datasets. The project aims to determine whether SPID can serve as a structural biomarker for treatment-induced biological changes.

## Overview

- **Objective**: Investigate SPID as a metric to distinguish treated from untreated cellular conditions.
- **Data**: Graph representations of molecular networks from three cell line pairs (e.g., SW-620/SW-620H).
- **Methods**: Statistical analysis of SPID distributions, controlling for graph size and density, with visualizations like violin plots and boxplots.
- **Expected Outcomes**: Insights into SPID's utility as a biomarker and its robustness across datasets.

## Deliverables

- Cleaned datasets and SPID computations.
- Statistical and visual analysis of SPID distributions.
- A final report summarizing findings.
- Reproducible code and data hosted in this repository.
